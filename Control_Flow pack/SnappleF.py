"""
Snapple is a famous tea drink brand from Queens, New York. Each bottle cap comes with a silly fun fact.

Use the random module to create a number from 0 to 5.

Then use an if/elif/else statement to print out one of these six random Snapple facts:
"""


import random

num=random.randint(0,5)

print(f"Here are some snapple factz   {num} ")
if num==0:
    print('Flamingos turn pink from eating shrimp.')
elif num ==1:
    print('The only food that doesn\'t spoil is honey.')
elif num==2:
    print('Shrimp can only swim backwards.')
elif num==3:
    print('A taste bud\'s life span is about 10 days.')   
elif num==4:
    print('It is impossible to sneeze while sleeping.')
elif num==5:
     print('It is illegal to sing off-key in North Carolina.')
else:
    print('IDK')
