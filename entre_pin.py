# 17. loopz while we loopz

"""
In programming, a loop is used to repeat a block of code until a specified condition is satisfied.
It's another incredibly powerful tool that's used a ton!

People will often use the generic term “iterate” when referring to loops;
iterate simply means “to repeat”.

The first kind of loop that we are going to learn is the while loop. 
You can think of the while loop like a traffic circle.

Each lap is one iteration! A car will iterate over and over again until it can't do so anymore.
