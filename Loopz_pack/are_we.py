“Are we there yet?” is a phrase that has existed for as long as there are children, vehicles,
and road trips.

First, ask the user “Are we there yet?” using the input() function and store it in an answer variable.

Then, use a while loop that asks the user “Are we there yet?” over and over again until
they respond with a “Yes”.

The output could look something like this:
"""
 #.lower()
answer=input("Are we there yet? ")

while answer.lower() !=  'yes':
    answer=input('Are we there yet?')
print('About time!')  


# passed
