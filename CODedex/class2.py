"""
Suppose we're building a food delivery app and want to store restaurants' info.

Create a Restaurant class in a restaurants.py file with the following attributes:

.name of the type str
.category of the type str
.rating of the type float
.delivery of the type bool
Make these empty/default values for now.

Nothing should happen when you run the code, because we have yet to use this class. 
In the next exercise, we will start using it!
