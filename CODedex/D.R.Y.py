A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. 
To execute this block of code, you just need to write the function's name, followed by a pair of parenthesis ( ).

Whether the task is five or twenty lines of code, you can throw it in 
a function and use it later anywhere in your program. It takes a little more effort initially but will save you a lot of time in the long term.

Plot twist! In this course, we have been using functions all along. 🧩

Built-in functions are 68 functions that come with the Python interpreter 
available for use. Here are some that you might recognize:

print()
input()
len()
We've used them before, but didn't get into how they work behind the scenes.

And that's okay! This is the beautiful part about built-in functions. 
Like a car, you don't need to know what's underneath the hood to operate it.

Let's look at some built-in Python functions!
Create a dry.py program and check out the complete list of built-in functions:

Find 4 built-in functions that we have used previously in the course.
Pick 1 built-in function that we have not seen before.
Use each of these once in the program.

For the new function, try to read the documentation (😵‍💫) or Google it (👍)!

Add a comment for each built-in function to explain how they work.
