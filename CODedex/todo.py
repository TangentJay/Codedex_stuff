List items are changeable, meaning we can update individual items within a list.

But before we do that, how can we access an individual item within a list? Well, this is where index comes in!

An index is an item's position in a list.

Python is 0-indexed, meaning that the indices starts at 0:

 Negative Index
Another thing to note about index is that it can be positive or negative.

If the index is negative, it starts from -1 (which is the last item of a list) and it goes backwards from there.

Slicing
Is there a way to get more than just one individual item? Yep! It's called slicing.

Slicing is where we can access certain parts of a sequence.

Instead of accessing an item using a single index like name[index], 
we can get multiple items by specifying where to start and where to end the range like name[start : end].
