"""
Here's a recap of everything we learned so far:

Control flow is the order in which the program's code executes.
if statement tests a condition for truth and executes the code if it's True.
elif clause can be added between if and else.
else executes the code if none of the above is True.
Relational operators are used to compare two values: ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=.
Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions: and, or, not.
Here's an if/elif/else statement in action just in case:
